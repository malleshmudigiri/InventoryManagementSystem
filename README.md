This project implements an Inventory Management System using Spring Boot and Java, featuring stock management, order fulfillment, supplier integration, and reporting. It allows adding, updating, and removing items, with automatic stock level updates upon order fulfillment. Users can create, update, and cancel orders, with automatic stock adjustments and order tracking details. The system manages suppliers, places automatic restock orders, and tracks incoming shipments. Additionally, it generates reports on stock levels, order statuses, and supplier performance.
